# Welcome to the Docs!

These pages document the Software Team's layout, structure, and best practices. Specifically, these pages will walk you through the structure of the rover, where to find code, and where to find documentation for the code. It will not walk you through the code itself or how to use it

The [Broken link](broken-reference "mention") section provides high-level details of the entire codebase, with later sections providing more details. Please read the entire Overview section to learn about the different parts of the rover, and, using that information, read through as much of the relevant docs for your tasks as possible. This will help give you a better context when writing code and help you ask more focused questions that go beyond "how does this work?"
