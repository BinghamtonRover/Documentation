# Welcome!

We are the Binghamton University Rover Team, and we are building a Mars rover to enter into the University Rover Challenge. The rover is a complex project, so these pages document our process, conventions, and guidelines.&#x20;

The pages on this site are split into five main categories, which you can switch between via the menu in the upper-left (or in the side menu on mobile devices).

* [Team details](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/cecka0SiHCkEKdZJzt6Q/s/lX3w5vgbyxScLPZkgeCk/ "mention") (this page). This section is an introduction to who we are, what we do, and how our team is organized. New members, students looking to join, or anyone interested in our project should start here.
* [Troubleshooting](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/cecka0SiHCkEKdZJzt6Q/s/bwphQGF7LcFlxAztxG7t/ "mention") Things go wrong. Often, even. When something isn't working, check here first for a solution. Each subteam should have these troubleshooting steps in the relevant places in their own documentation, and this section should contain links to all pages that could help in a crisis.
* [Software](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/cecka0SiHCkEKdZJzt6Q/s/Xy9UCQVV6ub6qMjWZys9/ "mention") This section documents the high-level structure of our software and how the different systems and devices interact. These docs are not a substitute for reading the code or documentation within an indvidual repository, and is more concerned with how the rover works than how to use our code. &#x20;
* [Electrical](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/cecka0SiHCkEKdZJzt6Q/s/bhTceLnBzIhrlO6WDIv5/ "mention") This section documents the different Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) designed by our Electrical team, as well as their general guidelines and rules for PCB design. Each PCB also comes with detailed specs and technical diagrams.&#x20;
* [Mechanical](http://127.0.0.1:5000/o/cecka0SiHCkEKdZJzt6Q/s/afr4EWTwHjeKu1J4SGlu/ "mention") We have several mechanical teams on the rover (Drive, Environmental Analysis, and Human-Robot-Environment Interaction). This section documents shared guidelines and design rules, as well as any documentation for each team.

As mentioned, these pages serve as a good starting point for learning about who we are, how we do what we do, and how to get started as a team member. The specific technical specs or docs for whatever you may be working on will most likely be found somewhere else and will be linked in the relevant sections. This site is also a good place to document concepts, topics, and protocols, that may be too abstract and complex to explain in a technical document.
