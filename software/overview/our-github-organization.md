# Our GitHub organization

We have several GitHub repositories under the Binghamton University Rover Team's GitHub Organization account. You can see them all at [https://github.com/BinghamtonRover](https://github.com/BinghamtonRover). There are a lot of repositories to view there, but you should use the header at the top of the organization page, which has links to all the actively-used repositories. The header is organized by topic, which should make more sense after reading the [architecture.md](architecture.md "mention") page.

The repositories are all public and read-only. All repositories protect the `main` branch against all pushes, especially force pushes. To make a change:

* Send your GitHub username to your team lead to ensure you have write access
* Clone the repository and make a new branch
* Make your changes on the new branch. Commit and push
* Open a new pull request, which must pass automatic and manual reviews
