# Git course

Like almost any other software group, we use Git to track our software, maintain backups, and merge changes between members. This onboarding course will teach you what you need to know about Git to be successful on the team, but these skills are highly transferrable to your future jobs. No prior knowledge or experience with Git is assumed, but you should be comfortable with a terminal and navigating through files and folders. Some very basic print statements in Python will be used to demonstrate example code.

This onboarding course won't go into everything Git or GitHub can do, but rather explain what problem they solve, how you can be productive with them, and some of the basic commands you'll need to get your work done. Git can be so complex that even very experienced developers will delete their entire projects and start over from a backup when something goes wrong. This course will try to give you the understanding you need to fix these issues directly.
